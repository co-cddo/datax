# Bilateral

Bilateral

Definition: one to one data exchange. Each exchange is individually agreed between producer and consumer - including the mechanism of exchange and relevant governance. This can be as simple as a CSV shared over email, or an API built for the purposes of a specific connection.

Use case: One organisation requires a data set from another, either for operational or analytical purposes. This may be a one-off or recurring transaction. The data transfer is conceived independently of any other relationships between the organisations and may use existing mechanisms or require new ones.

Benefits: The data transfer is precise - only the data needed is included - and low overhead. Easy to set up, and once set up may continue as necessary.

Issues: Each exchange has to be set up afresh. No economies of scale. Difficult to scale to provide the same data to multiple parties.

Data Privacy considerations: Each of these new, separate data exchanges will always require an in-depth DPIA to be carried out, whereas if it forms part of an existing sharing arrangement the same legal “guardrails” can be inherited, unless the use and purpose changes and it is then specific to that unique bilateral agreement. 

Example: This can be as simple as a CSV sent over email, or a basic transactional API.
