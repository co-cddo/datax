This tool, produced by the Data Strategy and Standards team in the Central Digital and Data Office has the following sections:

- [Data exchange principles](data-exchange-principles)
- [Common use cases](common-use-cases)
- [Governance](governance)
- [Data Exchange Patterns](data-exchange-patterns)

It is designed to allow you to explore subjects in more detail - seeing how principles map to use cases and then to recommended patterns. It is part of a suite of guidance and tooling aimed at exploring those problem spaces in more depth, including the Data Sharing Governance Framework and the [Data Standards Catalogue](https://api.gov.uk/sc).
