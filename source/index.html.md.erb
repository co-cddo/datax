# Data Exchange Guidance

<%= warning_text("This tool is designed to help you distinguish between the different kinds of data exchange, and what you need to consider when setting one up. It is in discovery and is meant to start a conversation about what patterns and principles for data exchange need to be recommended in government, as well as sharing learnings and best practice across the public sector. We appreciate feedback, either from the links at the bottom of each page, or directly to [datax@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](datax@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)") %>

This site, run by the Data Strategy and Standards team in the Central Digital and Data Office has the following sections:

- [Data exchange principles](data-exchange-principles)
- [Common use cases](common-use-cases)
- [Governance](governance)
- [Data Exchange Patterns](data-exchange-patterns)

This tool forms high level guidance on data sharing in government. It aims to frame the problems inherent in data sharing in such a way as to enable senior leaders to make informed decisions about data exchange projects and the teams needed to run them. Data sharing projects require expertise in technology, data, policy, and governance, but individuals come to them with their own priorities, and so this document aims to put the need for that broader expertise in context. It forms the introductory part of a suite of guidance and tooling aimed at exploring those problem spaces in more depth, including the Data Sharing Governance Framework and the [https://api.gov.uk/sc](Data Standards Catalogue).
